						<li>HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard markup language used to create web pages and web applications.
						</li>
						<li>It is the foundation of the World Wide Web, serving as the backbone for structuring and presenting content on the internet. 
						</li>
						<li>HTML consists of various elements, or tags, that define different parts of a web page, such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, images, forms, and more.
						HTML documents are saved with the .html or .htm file extension and are typically composed of two main sections: the &lt;head&gt; and the &lt;body&gt;. 
						</li>
						<li>The &lt;head&gt; section contains metadata and information about the web page, such as its title, character encoding, styles, scripts, and other resources. 
						</li>
						<li>The &lt;body&gt; section, on the other hand, contains the actual content that is displayed to the user, including text, images, videos, and interactive elements.
						By combining HTML with Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and JavaScript, web developers can create visually appealing, interactive, and dynamic web pages. 
						</li>	
						<li>HTML is relatively easy to learn and provides a solid foundation for beginners to start their web development journey. With its versatility and widespread use, HTML remains a crucial skill for anyone interested in creating or managing web content.
